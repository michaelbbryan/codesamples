# codesamples

This repository keeps code samples from several languages that I don't use on a continual or primary basis. As a result, I benefit from have my familiar past uses as examples for any future application.
* R
* Shell scripting
* SAS
* HTML
* PHP
* C

I have collected them over time from work utilities, class assignments and other lessons learned.
